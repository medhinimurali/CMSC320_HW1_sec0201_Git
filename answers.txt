Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git allows you to keep track of all the changes and updates you have made to your code. Whenever you push your code it pushes the newest most updated 
version, so you can go back and view your code's history. Git also allows multiple people to work together on code and view each other's changes.
