Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git allows you to keep track of all the changes and updates you have made to your code. Whenever you push your code it pushes the newest most updated 
version, so you can go back and view your code's history. Git also allows multiple people to work together on code and view each other's changes. 

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

help improve products and create more targeted advertising. 

Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: Merging joins the changes made in two different branches into the same place and maintains the history of branches and merges. On the other hand, rebase 
rebuilds the commits from one branch on to another branch, overwriting the history.
